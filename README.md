📈 Stock Price Prediction

📌 **Background Problem**:

In the ever-evolving landscape of financial markets, accurately predicting stock prices in a timely manner is crucial for investors to make well-informed decisions and effectively manage risks. However, traditional prediction methods often struggle to keep pace with the complexities and rapid changes inherent in market dynamics.

Challenges such as market volatility, information asymmetry among participants, and the influence of external factors like global economic trends and technological advancements further complicate prediction efforts. The absence of a centralized database, inconsistent records, and delayed information processing hinders the effectiveness of traditional stock forecasting methods.

To overcome these challenges, we propose an advanced stock price prediction system that leverages machine learning models and real-time data processing techniques to provide investors with **accurate and timely insights**.



🎯** Problem Statement** :

Existing stock price prediction methods suffer from :

•	**Inefficiencies in data processing**, leading to inaccuracies and delays.

•	**Lack of a centralized database**, resulting in inconsistencies in stock market records.

•	**Limited access to real-time market information**, affecting timely decision-making.

•	**Manual handling of stock market data**, increasing the risk of errors.

This project aims to build a robust and efficient system for stock price prediction that utilizes machine learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of stock forecasts.




🚀 **Project Description**:

The Stock Price Prediction project employs three machine learning models:

• **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
• **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
• **Decision Tree**

Additionally, a merged model combining these approaches is developed for enhanced prediction accuracy.

📊 **Data Source**: We utilize the **Yahoo Live Dataset**, extracting features like:

• Opening Value
• Closing Value
• Stock High
• Stock Volume
The project provides comparative analysis among the models (LSTM vs. KNN vs. Decision Tree) to determine the best-performing approach. The results are displayed in a **Streamlit web application**, offering an interactive and user-friendly interface.
